for training.
Doing some little exercises about string/number manipulation, algorithms.
This repository is for tracking my coding experience.
Maybe I'll add haskell, c, c++, python, go, C#, javascript repositories for bettering up my knowledge in those languages.
For now my knowledge in languages:

Java:                   . . .
C++:                    . .
C, C#, Python,
Haskell, x86Assembly:   .
